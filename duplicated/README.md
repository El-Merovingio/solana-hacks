# DISCLAMER
**It is important to note that this code is for demonstration purposes only and should not be used in a production environment.**

# Description
This code is prone to duplicated mutable accounts because the update function takes two account references, user_a and user_b, and updates their data. However, the code does not validate that these two accounts are distinct and unique. If the same account is passed twice, the data in that account will be updated twice, leading to unexpected behavior.
To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could call the update function with the same account twice. This would cause the data in that account to be updated twice, potentially leading to incorrect data or vulnerabilities in the program.

## Prevention
To prevent this vulnerability, the update function should validate that user_a and user_b are distinct and unique accounts. This can be done by comparing the two accounts' public keys and ensuring they are different. If the two keys are the same, the function should return an error indicating that the same account was passed twice. By validating the uniqueness of the accounts, the program can prevent unexpected behavior and vulnerabilities related to duplicated mutable accounts.
