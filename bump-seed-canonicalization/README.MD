# DISCLAMER
**It is important to note that this code is for demonstration purposes only and should not be used in a production environment.**

# Description
The code is prone to bump seed canonicalization because the program uses the amount field to generate the bump seed and calculate the account address. If the amount is changed, the account address will also change, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual addresses. This can cause issues when trying to modify an existing account with a different amount value. To mitigate this issue, the program should use a more stable value to generate the bump seed and calculate the account address, such as a unique identifier for the account.

# Exploit code
This is Rust code that interacts with the Solana blockchain through the Solana API. It defines two structs, MyInstruction and MyData, that are used to serialize and deserialize data that will be stored on the blockchain.

The code then creates a new account on the blockchain using the Create variant of MyInstruction, which initializes the amount of the account to 10. It does this by creating a new keypair for the authority, and then using that keypair to sign a transaction that creates a new account with the specified amount.

Next, the code requests an airdrop of SOL (the native token of the Solana blockchain) to a new keypair called fake_account. This is done to ensure that fake_account has enough funds to execute a later transaction.

The code then modifies the amount of the previously created account using the Modify variant of MyInstruction. It does this by creating a new transaction that updates the amount of the previously created account to 1000, using fake_account as the signer.

This code can exploit a program that is prone to seed bump canonicalization by creating a new account using a seed that is based on the amount of the account. If the program is not properly designed to handle changes to the seed, then this can result in the program accessing and modifying the wrong account.
